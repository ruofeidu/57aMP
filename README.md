57aMP: Create physical stamps using the thermal power of touch. 
=========

CMSC 838F Term Project by Tiffany Chao and Ruofei Du, supervised by Prof. Jon Froehlich.

What if you could create physical stamps using the heat? 

In 57aMP, we made a thermal touch pad, which turn from black to white when heated. We digitalized the thermal input into a 2D stamp using a mobile camera. While powering the pad with heat, the user could watch the real-time visualization via web (http://duruofei.com/57aMP). Finally, 3D stamp models were generated from the thermal input and we use 3D printer to make physical stamps from the heat.
